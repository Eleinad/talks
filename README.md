# Talks and Experiments
Hello fellows! This repo contains useful material related to my talks or anything I wanted to explore in my free time.

Enjoy!


# Talks
- <b>pycon_2025</b>: this folder contains the slides and code from my talk at the incredible <b>PyCon Italia 2025</b> conference in Bologna. 
<br>The session, titled <b>"Local LLM fine-tuning: a practical example"</b>, began with a brief introduction to local large language models (LLMs) and fine-tuning. I then demonstrated how to fine-tune an open-weight model like Metaâ€™s LLaMA. Finally, I showcased how to integrate the fine-tuned model into a ChatGPT-style user interface.

<br>During this session, titled <b>"Exploring Multi-Agent Systems with AutoGen"</b>, I introduced the concept of collaborative AI agents and their applications in solving complex problems. 
<br>I also showcased "AutoGen", an open-source framework by Microsoft framework that simplifies the creation and coordination of multiple agents.
<br>Finally, I walked through three practical demos: agent-to-agent conversation, a simulated health service onboarding system, and an autonomous Bitcoin market analysis.
